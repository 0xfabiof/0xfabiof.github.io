[Dataiku DSS - CVE-2020-8817 Advisory](https://doc.dataiku.com/dss/latest/security/advisories/cve-2020-8817.html)

## Affected asset(s)

* https://dataiku-dss-api/dip/api/projects/wikis/save-article

## Description

A user with access to a project that can Edit a Wiki Article can taint the input going to the API endpoint and replace the Created By attributes of the Wiki Article to be any other arbitrary values such as user, timestamp, etc. 

## Steps to reproduce

* A victim creates a new article

Figure 1 – Newly created article with valid Creation values 

   * Attacker accesses an article that he can edit: 

   * He intercepts the requests made to the API after Saving 

   * He replaces the values inside the json array corresponding to the Creation Tag (i.e. user, and timestamp):

Figure 3 - A third user (or any other user) accesses the article and sees the fake values injected by the attacker
  
## Impact
  
Compromise of integrity of Wiki Article functionality – an attacker can induce others to think it was an arbitrary user or even an unexisting user that created an article when it wasn’t 

## Prerequisites

 * Edit access to the article 

## Mitigation
 
Remove the possibility Creation Tag from being generated client-side and sent to the server via API without validation
